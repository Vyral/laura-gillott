Once winter arrives, one of the most common questions our team receives is whether sellers should wait until spring to put their home on the market. Actually, there are a number of benefits to listing during the winter, two of which we’d like to share with you today:

**1. There is less competition.** Many sellers choose to exit the market over the holiday season, leaving those who do list at this time a greater chance to stand out.

**2. Buyers are more serious during the winter.** While buyers in the spring and summer may be attracted to your listing more out of curiosity than by a genuine commitment to purchasing it, buyers in winter tend to be very resolute in their desire to strike a deal. You won’t find any tire kickers out and about at this time of year.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
