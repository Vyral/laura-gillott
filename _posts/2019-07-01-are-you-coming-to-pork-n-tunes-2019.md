I'm Laura Gillott and I've been a licensed broker in the state of Oregon since 1992. We’re excited to invite you to our FREE 2019 Pork N’ Tunes event on July 27 at 6 p.m. There will be a ton of great slow-roasted pork from our pitmaster, Shawn, as well as drinks, tractor-churned ice cream, live music, a car show and more. There will be some camping spots available, to be reserved in advance. We don't recommend anyone park on the street, but there will be plenty of parking available in the pasture. All you have to do is bring yourself, your family, your favorite side dish and your lawn chair or a blanket for watching the concert. To learn more about the event, watch our latest short video.
