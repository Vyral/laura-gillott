<br>Ben Franklin once said, “An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.” We agree and that is why our team is education-based and attends many training sessions—so our clients can profit from our education. If you click **[this link](https://www.teamgillott.com/info/classes){: target="_blank"}**, it will take you to our current class schedule. **All of our classes are complementary and I wanted to highlight a few of them.**

Each month we host a Seller Class. This is an informal seller happy hour where you will learn best practices from the pros. We’ll invite home, well, and septic inspectors to tell you what the top items are that need to be addressed during a home sale plus lender, title, and escrow representatives will be there to give you the latest updates on new regulations. In addition, you’ll walk away knowing our seven best steps for selling your home for top dollar in our current market.

We also offer a similar buyer happy hour, a re-sizing senior class, an investor course, a career night, a bare land class, and a home builder class. **This year, we are going to be teaching a business-to-business class with the 10 top skills KW teaches on how to run a successful business that can work with any trade.**

If you think you might be interested in any of these classes, please register **[here](https://www.teamgillott.com/info/classes){: target="_blank"}**. If you don’t want to wait for our next class, please call us for a private consultation today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
