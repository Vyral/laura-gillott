I wanted to personally invite you to attend our NEW YEARS DAY CELEBRATION on **January 1st from 11am to 4pm.** We’ll have some bubbly and hors d’oeuvres, music, great conversation, office tours, a photographer if you want a complementary family photo with the our offices’s board and bat backdrop or if you have purchased or sold a home with us anytime in the past 28 years we would love a SOLD sign snapshot to add to our marketing. This is open house style so please stop in and say hello. Our location is at 266 E Grant St here in Lebanon.

If any of your new years resolutions involves real estate please let us know and we’ll help be your accountability partner to ensure you have the best success! Remember Opportunity is never lost …. it simply moves on to someone else if you don’t seize it. I’m Laura Gillott and we are honored to be your real estate resource. Thank you for watching and sharing this video. We look forward to see you on the 1st!
