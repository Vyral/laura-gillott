Today I have the pleasure of introducing you to Jamie Melcher, a certified seller’s and senior real estate specialist. Education is important to her, and obtaining additional designations ensures she has the knowledge to help clients get their homes sold for top dollar in the least amount of time possible. In 2018, Jamie was able to help over 90 families get their homes sold. Having her knowledge and experience also helps her sell homes successfully, no matter the situation. Her passion to serve goes hand in hand with her real estate business.
