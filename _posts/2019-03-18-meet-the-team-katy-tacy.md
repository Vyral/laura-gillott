On this episode of “Meet the Team,” we’re spotlighting Katy Tacy (and her adorable dog, Sinch Tacy). Katy is a listing specialist and a lifelong Lebanon resident. She’s helped hundreds of families find homes and maintains a sparkling 99% list-to-sale price ratio. If you need to buy and sell a home at the same time, she’d love to meet with you and make a game plan so you don’t end up homeless. She’ll be able to provide you with a complimentary market analysis to show you your current equity and give you pointers to help your home sell for top dollar.
