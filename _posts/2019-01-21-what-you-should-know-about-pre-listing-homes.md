I'm Laura Gillott and I've been a licensed broker in the state of Oregon since 1992. Today we’ll be going over what pre-listing is, as well as what it means for you as a home seller.

Pre-listings occur when your home isn’t quite ready to be put on the market—you’re getting everything prepared to sell. Pre-listing paperwork will be completed and your home will be put into the MLS, but only agents will be able to see it. Agents can share these upcoming homes for sale with their clients, which is great—buyers could postpone a purchase until they’re able to see your home.

**You’re not able to show your property during a pre-listing.** However, you can show it online to prospective buyers. As mentioned earlier, agents are also able to show their clients upcoming homes. When you’re in the pre-listing stage, there’s no specific time you have to go active—technically, a home could stay pre-listed forever (but also couldn’t be shown). However, if buyers write an offer subject to viewing, they can certainly come and view the home.

The number of days on market does not begin accumulating during pre-listing—it begins when your home goes active on the market. **You can keep your home pre-listed and make it active when potential buyers begin appearing**. If your home is pre-listed on the MLS, you can put a sign in your yard that says so. “Coming Soon” signs can help generate interest in your home.

Our MLS requires one photo of the front of your property, but it isn’t necessary to use more than this picture during pre-listing. You should be spending the time in pre-listing to get the professional photos you’ll use when you make the listing active.
