How do private wells impact the sale of homes here in Oregon?&nbsp;

If you’re a seller and the domestic water for your property is supplied by a private well, you’re required by state law to test the well for total coliform bacteria, arsenic, and nitrates. The test must be performed through an accredited laboratory, a list of which can be found on the [Oregon Health Authority](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/HealthyEnvironments/DrinkingWater/SourceWater/DomesticWellSafety/Pages/index.aspx){: target="_blank"} website under the “Domestic Wells Safety” section.&nbsp;

**You must report the lab test results to both the Oregon Health Authority and the buyer within 90 days of receiving them,** and you should use a domestic well testing transaction form to do so. **A link for this form can be found [here](https://apps.state.or.us/Forms/Served/le8313.pdf){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;**

These test results are valid for one year, and you should verify that the proper sampling and testing procedures are performed when having the well tested. **More information on this state law requirement can be found [here](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/HEALTHYENVIRONMENTS/DRINKINGWATER/SOURCEWATER/DOMESTICWELLSAFETY/Pages/Testing-Regulations.aspx){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;**

**You may also want to have the well tested for other contaminants to further determine water quality,** but you aren’t required to do so. Proper procedures need to be used when testing domestic wells, and you can find more information on this state law requirement under the “FAQ” section of the Oregon Health Authority website mentioned above.&nbsp;

Finally, Oregon requires that all private wells not already registered with the state of Oregon be registered at the time the property is transferred. Real estate forms in use in Oregon often delegate to the buyer the responsibility for registering the well with the Oregon Water Resources Department (OWRD). **A useful guide to the OWRD well identification program can be found [here](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/HEALTHYENVIRONMENTS/DRINKINGWATER/SOURCEWATER/DOMESTICWELLSAFETY/Documents/OHA%208316%20Well%20Water%20Handbook%20Final.pdf){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;**
