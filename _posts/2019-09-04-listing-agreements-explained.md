Oregon law requires that an agreement authorizing or employing a broker to sell real estate for compensation or commission be in writing. Such agreements are known as listing agreements. In short, these documents are an agreement between the seller and their agent, and will allow the agent to take all the necessary steps to sell a home—like placing it on the multiple listing service.&nbsp;

**Listing agreements also contain the seller’s asking price, the duration of the listing, the broker’s compensation, along with other terms and conditions.&nbsp;**

Many listing agreements contain addendums known as “liquidated damages clauses,” which sellers should read carefully, as these clauses outline the potential consequences a seller may incur in the event that the listing agreement is broken.&nbsp;

Most listing agreements also contain provisions on how any forfeited earnest money will be distributed between the seller and broker.

All in all, it’s important that sellers review their listing agreement carefully before proceeding with a deal.&nbsp;
