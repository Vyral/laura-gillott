Dave Adams was originally an agent in Texas who I have been recruiting since 2015 to join our team. After joining us in 2018, he has been working with clients here in the Willamette Valley. As a listing specialist, he works with sellers to help them sell their home for top dollar and negotiate on their behalf. He only works with sellers and is 100% committed to being a fantastic fiduciary in every transaction. On top of that, heâ€™s been involved with some great local organizations such as the Boys and Girls Club and Chamber Ambassadors.
