For this episode of “Meet the Team,” we’re introducing you to listing specialist MacKenzie Greenly. MacKenzie’s role is to guide you through the home selling process, and she has an entire team behind her to make sure your home is advertised and marketed correctly, in addition to the transaction coordinators who will make your transaction seamless and smooth. As a native to Lebanon, MacKenzie loves our community and feels extremely blessed to be a part of it. She loves helping people sell their home and find their next “forever” home, and she would be honored to assist you with one of the biggest financial decisions you’ll ever make.
