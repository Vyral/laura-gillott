Many people have been asking us about the Corvallis real estate market. Here are the latest numbers and news that you need to know about. Year over year, home values are up 10.4% in Corvallis, 12.6% in Albany, 13.1% in Lebanon, and 13.5% in Sweet Home. Last year at this time, Corvallis’ average price was $361,000, and now the average is $398,000. That’s a 10% increase. In terms of pending listings, we have 65 this year, where we had 62 last year.

**These statistics show us that we are still in a strong seller’s market.&nbsp;**

There are, however, **some indications of our market shifting**, like the increased inventory we’ve seen. Normally, the indicator that we’re shifting from a seller’s to a buyer’s market is having more than six months of inventory on the market, but we’re not there yet. Our inventory is still limited, and prices are still going up. That, plus the fact that interest rates are on the rise, means that it’s a great time to be a homeowner.

Another item we pay attention to in our market reports is pre-listings. This year, we have about 71 pre-listings in Linn and Benton Counties, which is about 30 more than we had this same time last year. As a buyer, a nice thing about pre-listings is that they’re syndicated listings; they’re listings that only Realtors know about and are coming soon to the market. **If you’re a buyer in the market, you should talk to your Realtor about a list of pre-listed homes so that you can be one step ahead of everyone else in the market.** That will allow you to get all of your ducks in a row that much earlier so that you can make an offer on the home with no competition from other buyers.

If you have any questions about the trends in our market, you’re always encouraged to reach out to us. We’d love to help you out. Until then, happy holidays!
