I’m pleased to introduce you today to Bill Flesher, a longtime resident of Lebanon. He’s very active in the community, whether that be with the Lebanon Chamber of Commerce, Lebanon’s transportation and airport review projects, or with many of the local businesses and organizations that he’s involved in. On top of that, Bill has been a broker in commercial real estate sales since 2001 and is experienced in all aspects of commercial real estate.
