Welcome back to another real estate message\! I'm Laura Gillott and I've been a licensed broker in the state of Oregon since 1992, and, today, I’ve brought on one of my team’s listing specialists, Katy Tacy, to explain the term “MLS.” In short, the MLS, or multiple listing service, provides information to real estate professionals about available properties. Filing a listing with the MLS exposes local buyers and agents to the property, making it a very powerful tool for sellers and Realtors alike. The MLS is also a way for listing brokers to offer compensation to other brokers who may be aware of a suitable buyer for a given property. It is the ability to attract buyers through their agents that makes the MLS so valuable. With that in mind, all data on the MLS must be accurate, so sellers should carefully review any information about their property as reflected on the MLS and bring up any discrepancies or concerns to their agent right away. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
