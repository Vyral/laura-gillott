Today we’re going to discuss well testing. Here’s what you need to know:

If domestic water is supplied by a private well, **the seller will need to make certain the well provides adequate water for domestic needs.** It is fully recommended that a well flow test be conducted of any property that depends on a well for domestic water.

Meticulous consideration should be paid to disclosures or representations about wells. The seller should not allow the buyer to rely on a test done for the seller. The buyer should be advised to contract and pay for their own well test. Sellers should review any well records they may have, as buyers will often ask to see these records.

Interested sellers can obtain more information about well logs and have access to the well log database here.&nbsp;

While real **estate licensees are not trained and do not have the expertise to test wells,** they should be able to direct the seller to the appropriate well professionals. Disclosures and disclaimers regarding domestic wells are frequent in real estate transactions and should be reviewed with the seller’s agent as part of the contract negotiations.&nbsp;
