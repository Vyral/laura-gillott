I'm Laura Gillott and I've been a licensed broker in the state of Oregon since 1992. **Obtaining a professional home inspection is the single most important thing that a buyer can do to protect their interests.** A professional home inspection report will provide detailed information about a home’s physical condition, its systems and fixtures, and note any potential future problems. The buyer should carefully review an inspector’s proposal to determine the scope of the inspection.&nbsp;

**A home inspection should be done by a home inspector or a licensed contractor with the State of Oregon.** To inspect two or more components, such as the roof and siding, the home inspector must be certified as either a licensed construction contractor or work with a licensed construction company. The inspector is not allowed to perform any repairs on the home within a 12-month period following the inspection.&nbsp;

Here’s a [link](https://www.oregon.gov/CCB/licensing/Pages/home-inspectors.aspx) to review state home inspector requirements. You can also get more information from the [Oregon Association of Home Inspectors](https://www.oahi.org/) or the [International Association of Certified Home Inspectors](https://www.nachi.org/).

Inspection of property is beyond the scope of expertise of a real estate agent. However, real estate licensees can provide buyers with a list of local inspectors. **Licensees will ordinarily not recommend one specific inspector.** Before hiring one, you should check with the CCB to determine the inspector’s current license status, which you can do here.

Buyers should not rely on any reports done for previous buyers or sellers. The reports may not be accurate and they would have no recourse against an inspector they have not retained. **Most contracts include a clause that allows a buyer to withdraw from an agreement if a professional inspection shows defects on a property.**

Unless otherwise provided in the sales contract, the cost of the inspection won’t be refunded if you withdraw from the agreement.&nbsp;

I you have any questions for me in the meantime or any real estate needs I can assist with, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
