Today we’re going to talk a little bit about the seller’s disclosure property statement.

**In Oregon, most sellers of residential properties are required to fill out, sign, and deliver a statutory property disclosure form.** The form, which covers everything from title status to dwelling systems and fixtures, is set out in form ORS 105.464.&nbsp;

Because the form is statutory, it cannot be changed or modified. All questions on the statutory form must be answered based on the actual knowledge of the seller at the time an offer is made on the property. A copy of the form can be found online using [this link.](https://eforms.com/images/2018/08/Oregon-Sellers-Property-Disclosure-Statement.pdf)

Unless a seller qualifies for one of the narrow exclusions contained in the statute or the buyer is not purchasing the property for his immediate family to live in, the completed disclosure form must be delivered to every buyer who makes a written offer on the property.&nbsp;

If the seller does deliver the disclosure statement, the buyer’s ability to revoke is limited to five business days after delivery. The exclusions available under the statute are listed on the first page of the disclosure form. They include:

* The first sale of a dwelling never occupied
* Sales by financial institutions
* Sales by court-appointed receivers
* Trustees
* Personal representatives
* Sales by government agencies

All other sellers of residential properties must answer questions the legislature has determined are relevant in the purchase of residential property. The disclosure statement questions may be answered, “yes,” “no,” “unknown,” or in limited circumstances, “N/A.”

**Answering “unknown” to avoid disclosure of known information can be considered a form of fraud.** Some questions, if answered yes, require an explanation or copy of the report or another document to be attached to the disclosure statement. Because the disclosure statement must be filled out by the seller based on their actual knowledge at the time of disclosure, real estate licensees can not fill out the form for the seller or influence the seller’s answers in any way. Real estate licenses are required to make the seller aware of the seller’s disclosure duties under the statute.

Another great resource is the Oregon Real Estate Advisory pamphlet, for both **[buyers](https://oregonrealtors.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Oregon-Property-Buyer-Advisory_2019.pdf){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;**and [**sellers**.](https://oregonrealtors.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Oregon-Property-Seller-Advisory_2019.pdf){: target="_blank"}
