Today I’d like you to meet another wonderful member of my team: Jon Sugden. Jon is a top-producing agent who is a Benton County expert. After 12 years as a contractor in the valley working side by side with many of the area’s top builders, Jon decided to take his passion to real estate. His expertise is invaluable for homebuyers, especially during the inspection phase where his eagle eye works magic. Jon is an invaluable member of our team and can help you out no matter what your situation is.
