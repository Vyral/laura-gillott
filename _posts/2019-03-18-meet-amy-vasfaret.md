Today I’m excited to introduce you to buyer’s agent Amy Vasfaret. She strives to negotiate the best price possible for her clients while also wanting to listen and understand each person’s distinctive needs while communicating effectively. She genuinely loves helping people and being able to do that in an honest and transparent way is important to me. She knew that in order to be successful, she needed to surround herself with the professionals who hold similar core values and are ready to help and guide her when she needs it. &nbsp;As a team, we pride ourselves on helping families accomplish their real estate goals every single day.
