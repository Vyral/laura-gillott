I’m excited to introduce you to another great member of our team today: Sue Tuller. Selecting a real estate agent to represent you when buying a home is a difficult decision, but hiring Sue is an easy one. She’s a Willamette Valley native who has seen the community transform and redefine from timber towns to diversified communities. Through hard work and education, she is applying her drive and dedication to her clients. She has one goal: To make every client a client for life through superior service and customer care.
