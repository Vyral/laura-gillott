We’ve added five new agents and a new admin to our team in order to help us service your real estate needs, so **if you know anyone in Lane County or Marion County who needs to buy or sell a home, we’re ready and waiting.&nbsp;**

In Marion County, we’re proud to have added Samantha Dalke to the team—a highly experienced agent who works with buyers and sellers and specializes in ranch property.

Lane County is where you can find the other four great additions, including:

* Deb and Wayne Elliott. Before entering the real estate business, they both worked in the forestry industry. If you want to buy or sell timber property, they’re an excellent resource. Debbie is also a principal broker.&nbsp;
* Sherry Burkett and Shawna Bowers. Both of them work with buyers and sellers, and they handle both residential and farming and ranch properties.&nbsp;

Erin Hill, meanwhile, is our new admin specialist, and she worked at another real estate team processing short sales before joining us. If you need to conduct a short sale, she can help you process it so you don’t owe any money after closing.&nbsp;
